# Email Routing

The **SMS Alert** email routing feature allows you to automatically forward incoming text messages to designated email addresses, making it easier to manage and respond to messages in a timely manner. Here’s how this feature works:

## Automatic Email Forwarding
As soon as a text message is received and matches the rules you've set, the app forwards the message content to the specified email address(es). This ensures that important messages are delivered straight to your inbox, where you can manage them alongside your other communications.

## Customizable Email Format
You can customize the format of the forwarded emails. This includes:
- **Sender's Phone Number**: Include the phone number of the sender.
- **Time and Date**: Add the timestamp of when the message was received.
- **Message Content**: Include the message content in the body of the email for easy reading and response.

## Multiple Email Addresses
Forward messages to multiple email addresses simultaneously. This is particularly useful for team environments where several people need to be informed of incoming messages.

## Subject Line Customization
Set custom subject lines for your forwarded emails. You can include dynamic elements such as:
- **Sender’s Number**: Make it easier to identify who the message is from.
- **Specific Keywords**: Highlight important messages based on their content.

## Attachment Handling
If the incoming message includes attachments (such as images or files sent via MMS), these can be forwarded as email attachments, ensuring that all content is preserved.

## Priority Email Routing
Set priorities for different types of messages, so critical messages are marked as high-priority in your inbox. This helps you quickly identify and respond to urgent communications.

## Time-Based Routing
Configure time-based rules to route messages to different email addresses at different times of the day. For example:
- **Business Hours**: Forward messages to your work email.
- **After Hours**: Route messages to a personal email.

## Email Filtering and Tagging
Automatically apply filters or tags to incoming messages based on content or sender. This helps in organizing and categorizing your emails for easier management and follow-up.

## Spam and Unwanted Message Handling
Set up rules to automatically discard or filter out spam or unwanted messages, ensuring that only relevant communications are forwarded to your email.

## Backup and Archive
All forwarded emails can be backed up or archived, ensuring you have a record of all communications in case you need to refer back to them later.

## Security and Privacy
Emails are sent securely, and no message content is stored outside of your email client unless you choose to archive it. This ensures that your messages are handled with the utmost confidentiality.

The email routing feature is a powerful tool for ensuring that important text messages are seamlessly integrated into your email workflow, allowing you to stay organized and responsive, no matter where you are.
