# Security & Privacy

Ensuring the security and privacy of your data is a top priority. Our app incorporates robust security measures and privacy protocols to safeguard your incoming text messages and personal information. Hereâ€™s how we protect your data:

## Data Encryption
All data transmitted between your mobile device, our app, and external services is encrypted using industry-standard encryption protocols (e.g., TLS/SSL). This ensures that your messages are secure during transmission and protected from unauthorized access.

## Secure Authentication
The app uses secure authentication methods to verify user identity. This includes options such as:
- **Secure Login Credentials**: Protect your account with strong passwords.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Add an extra layer of security.
