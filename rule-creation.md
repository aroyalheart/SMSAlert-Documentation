# Rule Creation

The ability to create customized rules is at the heart of **SMS Alert**'s functionality, giving you complete control over how incoming text messages are processed and forwarded. Here’s how the rule creation feature works:

## Intuitive Rule Builder
The app features a user-friendly rule builder that allows you to set up rules in just a few clicks. No coding or technical expertise is required—simply choose your conditions and actions from drop-down menus.

## Condition-Based Rules
Create rules based on specific conditions, such as:
- **Keywords**: Specific words or phrases found in the message content.
- **Sender's Phone Number**: The phone number from which the message is received.
- **Time of Day**: The time when the message is received.
- **Message Length**: The length of the message.

These conditions ensure that messages are only forwarded when they meet your criteria.

## Multiple Conditions
Combine multiple conditions to refine your message routing. For example, you can set a rule to forward a message only if it contains a specific keyword and comes from a particular phone number.

## Flexible Actions
Define what happens when a rule is triggered. Actions can include:
- **Forwarding the Message**: To an email address, a Slack channel, a Telegram bot, a WhatsApp contact, or a custom API.
- **Multiple Destinations**: Forward messages to several destinations simultaneously.

## Priority and Order
Set the priority of your rules, so the app knows which rules to apply first when multiple conditions are met. This allows you to handle more complex scenarios and avoid conflicts between rules.

## Time-Based Rules
Create time-sensitive rules that only activate during certain hours or days. This is perfect for managing messages differently during office hours versus after hours.

## Rule Testing
Before activating a rule, you can test it to see how it would handle a sample message. This helps you fine-tune your rules and ensure they work exactly as intended.

## Rule Management
Easily manage and edit your rules from within the app. You can enable, disable, or delete rules at any time, and make adjustments as your needs change.

## Rule Backup
The app allows you to back up your rules, so you can restore them if you change devices or need to reinstall the app.

By offering a powerful and flexible rule creation system, **SMS Alert** empowers you to tailor message handling to suit your specific needs, ensuring that every message is routed exactly where it needs to go.
